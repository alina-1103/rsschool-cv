### About me
I'm 26 tears old. I've started a career in 2018 on the position planning technician at the energy department at the brewery. I’ve taken a part in integration of Lean TPM system: AM (autonomous maintenance), PM (productive maintenance), 5S, H&S (Health&Safety), T&D (Teach&Develop) while working. I was focused on reprocessing presentations about these themes for employees and was spreading this information for staff, in addition I’ve learnt contract management and estimate business. A few years later I moved to the planning department, where my responsibilities included creating filling plans, filtration plans, brew plans for productions on a daily basis.
Some time ago I was passing html, css, javascript course. 
I want to have a job where there is always space for development and there are no limits to opportunities.
